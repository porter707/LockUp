# LockUp
LockUp is a free and open source tool, designed to help you secure your personal data before it leaves your computer!

The aim of this project is to provide the user with a simple and fast way to securely store their files, without the user having to do anything special or have any particular knowledge. The past few years there have been a number of leaks that suggest government agencies are spying on civilians, the UK government are also trying to force companies to provide back door access to user data. Government agencies are not the only threat to user data hackers also pose a threat and although online storage providers try to secure user data the weakest link in security is always the user, as they may have used a weak password or could be socially engineered. This project will try to address the issue of backdoor access or weak user security by having the user encrypt their files before sharing with a third party storage provider using a cryptographically secure key.
